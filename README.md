# Utopacos

Utopacos is a companion project to my larger project, *Utopac*. The idea was to leverage the website [Phil Opp's OS Development Guide](https://os.phil-opp.com/) as a starting point, but the tasks I need to accomplish, such as networking, are more complex than what the guide covers. This means that if I want to build a bare-bones operating system in Rust, I will need to start from scratch and create everything myself.

For now, *Utopacos* serves as a reference and a personal reminder. Currently, the OS doesn't do much beyond displaying text, but it will be useful as a point of reference for future work.

## Features

- **Basic OS Boot**: Displays text during the boot process.
- **Rust-based Architecture**: Built using the Rust programming language.
- **Reference Project**: Keeps track of the steps and decisions taken during OS development.
- **Learning Resource**: A resource to remember the complexity of OS development tasks like networking, which need to be implemented from the ground up.
